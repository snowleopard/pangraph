# pangraph [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tuura/pangraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tuura/pangraph)  

Pangraph is a Haskell library which offers parsing and serializations for graph files. As well as conversions to other Haskell graph formats. An example format is [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/). A graphml file
could for example represent the following graph, with vertices from `A` to `E` and connections, the edges, between them.

## Usage
Pangraph provides an API in the module `Pangraph` for construction and   
manipulation of graphs. The parsers in the library use this module to   
generate pangraphs. Parsers and serializers are imported from modules  
individually. This example shows imports for GraphML.
```haskell
import Pangraph.GraphML.Parser (parse)
import Pangraph.GraphML.Writer (write)
```
Usage of multiple file types in the same module will require  
qualified imports. Please see `src/Pangraph/Examples` for further examples.

## Building
Using cabal, dependencies track stack lts where possible.
```haskell
cabal update
cabal new-build
cabal new-test
```

Or Stack
```haskell
stack init
stack test
```
